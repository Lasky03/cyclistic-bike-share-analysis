Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company operating in Chicago. Since launching its bike-share offering in 2016, the company has grown to operate over 5,800 bicycles distributed across 692 docking stations. Cyclistic offers various types of bikes, including standard bikes, reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making it more inclusive for riders with different needs.

Currently, Cyclistic offers three pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Riders who use single or day passes are considered **casual riders**, while those who purchase annual plans are considered **members**. According to Cyclistic’s financial team, annual members generate more consistent and higher revenue for the company compared to casual riders.

Lily Moreno, the Director of Marketing, believes the key to the company’s future growth is increasing the number of annual members. Instead of targeting new customers, she sees a strong opportunity to **convert existing casual riders into annual members**. Casual riders are already familiar with the Cyclistic service and have made a decision to ride with them, making them potential candidates for conversion.

As a junior data analyst on the marketing analytics team, I have been assigned to investigate the following question:

> **"How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?"**

Answering this question is crucial for understanding behavioral patterns and usage differences, which will serve as the foundation for building a data-driven marketing strategy. This strategy aims to encourage casual users to become committed annual members, thereby boosting long-term profitability and customer retention.

The final deliverables of this case study will include:
- A clear statement of the business task (this file)
- Data source overview and documentation
- Data cleaning and transformation process
- Summary of key insights based on data analysis
- Visualizations to support findings
- Three strategic recommendations based on the results
